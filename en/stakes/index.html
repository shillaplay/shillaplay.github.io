The user-generated lastplayer games give players the chance of being the lastplayer standing. The game prizes can be seen as an auction to win. Only that players bid the same amount for the prize. So instead of it being the highest bidder wins, as it is in auction rooms, the last bidder wins in the lastplayer game.
